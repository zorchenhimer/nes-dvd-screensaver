# DVD Screensaver on the NES
## What? Why?

I thought it'd be funny.  That's why.

# Assembling
## Requirements

See this guide for setting up the build environtment: [NES_Build_Environment.md](https://gist.github.com/zorchenhimer/b5e1f30feb082f5a920c6b7e7a072b13)

## How Do

```
$ git clone https://github.com/zorchenhimer/nes-dvd-screensaver.git
$ cd nes-dvd-screensaver
$ make
```

After a successful `make` you'll have a `bin/` folder with a bunch of stuff in it, namely the `.nes` rom file.
